  You are assisting in a newborn resuscitation simulation. The video is recorded from above a resuscitation table. A mannequin representing a newborn baby may or may not be present. Based on the visual evidence, respond to the following questions. Be explicit and unambiguous.

prompts_0s:
  - "Describe the scene in the clip and give it a caption. Is the baby or mannequin present on the resuscitation table? Be explicit and clear about visibility."
  - "Describe the scene and give it a caption. Is the baby or mannequin visible on the table? If yes, is a health worker holding a large ventilation mask over the mannequin's face, covering both mouth and nose? This action supports breathing and is distinct from tube insertion. Be explicit. If there is not a baby / mannequin visible, no treatment is being performed."
  - "Describe the scene and give it a caption. Is the baby or mannequin visible on the table? If yes, is a health worker performing up-and-down stimulation on the mannequin's back, buttocks, or trunk? These are small, quick movements. Be clear and specific. If there is not a baby / mannequin visible, no treatment is being performed."
  - "Describe the scene and give it a caption. Is the baby or mannequin visible on the table? If yes, is a health worker inserting a small tube into the mouth or nose of the mannequin to provide suction? This cannot occur at the same time as mask ventilation. Be explicit. If there is not a baby / mannequin visible, no treatment is being performed."
